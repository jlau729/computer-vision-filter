For some reason, I had trouble using opencv on attu so I had to run it locally on my mac.
The normal way of running python on my mac of using "python Main.py" had trouble finding and using the opencv library
so I had to use the following commands to use and install the python libraries

python -m venv work
source work/bin/activate
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python==4.1.2.30
