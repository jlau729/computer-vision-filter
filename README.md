# Computer Vision Face Censorship Project
## Group Members: Jennifer Lau and Steven Luong
### Project Background
We are trying to solve the issue of privacy in pictures. We are planning to detect faces within a picture and censor them to maintain the privacy of those people. By censoring, we mean using stickers or other preselected images will be used to cover a personâ€™s face to hide their identity.

### Resources Used
We are thinking about writing the face detection code from scratch; we are planning to create the AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to help our code learn and recognize faces in a picture.
